# EECS 268 - Programming II

Taken with [Dr. John Gibbons](https://eecs.ku.edu/people/john-gibbons) in Spring 2022

Lab instructions are found at https://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/ittc_wiki/index.php?title=EECS268:Labs, note that this page is regularly updated and
requirements change by semester. 

**So this code is most likely similar but not the same as what is required, the rubrics for each lab have been lost to time ☹️**

## Grades

> [!CAUTION]
> Lab 01 - Code documentation: -2 No method descriptions Input validation: -2 Does not check for negative year (option 2), negative time (option 3), or negative rating (option 5)
>
> Lab 02 - Modularity -4 Function class is missing. Functions are meant to hold their name and whether they can handle an exception RETURN -3 Does not add the process back into the queue RAISE -5 Not implemented Stability -8 Does not check for invalid commands like doing CALL, RETURN, or RAISE with no processes in the queue leading to crashes Comments and documentation -5 Missing method docstrings
>
> Lab 08 - Program stability -3 Program crashes when removing a nonexistent key
>
> Lab 09 - Stability -3 Program crashes if NEXT or TREAT happens when there are no patients in the heap

## Posting Solutions
Students are forbidden from posting any solutions to labs or exams publicly as long as you are a student at KU. This includes, but is not limited to, a personal github repository.

You reuse code for future personal projects, but anything you post publicly must not be a solution for any EECS 168 or 268 assignment nor should it be easily searchable (e.g. the name of your repository is "EECS 168 Lab##").

Any posting of a solution, even for the purposes of sharing with an employer, will be considered an act of academic misconduct.
