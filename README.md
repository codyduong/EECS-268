See disclaimer below, this repo will be made public when I am no longer a student at KU.

Written for KU EECS 268 Spring 2022 taught by Professor John Gibbons.

```
## Posting Solutions
Students are forbidden from posting any solutions to labs or exams publicly as long as you are a student at KU. This includes, but is not limited to, a personal github repository.

You reuse code for future personal projects, but anything you post publicly must not be a solution for any EECS 168 or 268 assignment nor should it be easily searchable (e.g. the name of your repository is "EECS 168 Lab##").

Any posting of a solution, even for the purposes of sharing with an employer, will be considered an act of academic misconduct.
